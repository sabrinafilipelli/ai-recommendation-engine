This project uses the OpenAI GPT-3 text-davinci-003 and Vercel Edge functions with streaming. It generates tv show recommendations based on the form and user input, sends it to the GPT-3 API then streams the response back to the app. Demo can be found at: ai-recommendation-engine-git-main-sabrinafilipelli.vercel.app
